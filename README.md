## Features

&nbsp;

## Install

The primary intention was to use Cloak Swift as a [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) plugin, however, it can also be used as a standard CLI tool as well.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üñ• As a Tuist Plugin

To set up as a Tuist plugin in your project simply follow the [Tuist plugin install instructions](https://docs.tuist.io/plugins/using-plugins/) using the [latest version](https://github.com/lordcodes/cloak-swift/releases/latest).

Add the plugin to `Config.swift`.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .git(url: "https://github.com/lordcodes/cloak-swift.git", tag: "{ENTER_LATEST_VERSION}")
    ]
)
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üñ• Standalone via Swift Package Manager

Cloak Swift can be easily installed globally using Swift Package Manager.

```terminal
 git clone https://github.com/lordcodes/cloak-swift
 cd cloak-swift
 make install
```

This will install cloakswift into `/usr/local/bin`. If you get a permission error it may be that you don't have permission to write there in which case you just need to adjust permissions using `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin`.

You can uninstall it again using `make uninstall` which simply deletes it from `/usr/local/bin`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üç∫ Homebrew

Support for Homebrew may be planned in the future.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üì¶ As a Swift package

To install Cloak Swift for use in your own Swift code, add it is a Swift Package Manager dependency within your `Package.swift` file. For help in doing this, please check out the Swift Package Manager documentation.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/lordcodes/cloak-swift", exact: "0.0.1")
```

&nbsp;

## Usage

### üñ• Via the Tuist Plugin

Ensure you have fetched with `tuist fetch` and you will then be able to run the plugin's tasks.

```terminal
USAGE: tuist cloak <createkey|version> [-q|--quiet]

ARGUMENTS:
  <createkey>             Create encryption key.
  <version>               Prints out the current version of the tool.

OPTIONS:
  -q, --quiet             Silence any output except errors 
```

### üñ• Via the Standalone CLI

```terminal
USAGE: cloakswift <createkey|version> [-q|--quiet]

ARGUMENTS:
  <createkey>             Create encryption key.
  <version>               Prints out the current version of the tool.

OPTIONS:
  -q, --quiet             Silence any output except errors 
```

### üì¶ As a Swift Package

To use Cloak Swift within your own Swift code, import and use the public API of `CloakKit`.

```swift
import CloakKit

// Configure printing
Cloak.configuration.printer = ConsolePrinter(quiet: false)

// Create key
EncryptionService().createKey()
```
